## Mobisec (Dated 2015)

Mobisec is a secure document based reader solution developed for the iOS platform during my tenure at iData Inc. The iOS application is responsible for making requests and downloading information from a web server before storing it in a local encrypted database (Empress Embedded Database). This solution allows central distributors to disseminate documents to its end-users without need to worry about the information being stolen on the device and/or being moved off the authorized device to another tablet.
